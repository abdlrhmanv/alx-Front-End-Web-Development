# 🚀 ALX Frontend Web Development Course

Welcome to my repository for the **ALX Frontend Web Development** program — a hands-on, intensive 18-week journey into modern web development.

Here you'll find all the weekly tasks, mini-projects, and exercises I completed throughout the course, covering everything from the basics of the web to building real applications using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React**.
