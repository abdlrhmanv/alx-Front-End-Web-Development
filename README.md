# 🚀 ALX Frontend Web Development - Course Summary

Welcome to the official repository for my journey through the **ALX Frontend Web Development** program — an intensive, 18-week, project-based curriculum designed to transform beginners into job-ready frontend developers.

This repo serves as a **comprehensive, structured, and searchable archive** of everything I've learned: from shell commands and Git, to building a full React capstone project with Tailwind CSS.

> 📌 *This isn't just code — it's a living portfolio of growth, peer collaboration, and real-world problem-solving.*

## 🤝 Peer Learning Days (PLD)

**Peer Learning Days (PLD)** are **mandatory** collaborative sessions designed to deepen understanding through discussion, not solution-sharing.

### 🎯 Objectives:
- Ensure everyone understands the concepts
- Practice articulating technical thought processes
- Strengthen cohort-wide problem-solving skills

### 🛠️ Structure:
1. **Define Objectives**: Vote on which tasks to review, starting with the lowest-numbered task needing clarification.
2. **Whiteboard Solutions**: Take turns explaining your approach — no code yet!
3. **Pair Programming**: After whiteboarding, implement solutions together.
4. **Share Progress**: Report bottlenecks and wins to staff or TAs.

### 🚫 Important Rules:
- ❌ No photos or notes during whiteboarding — stay engaged.
- ❌ No sharing of code files — focus on **thought process**.
- ✅ Help each other understand — teaching strengthens your own knowledge.

> 🌟 *"Modeling your thinking is more valuable than giving answers."*

## 📊 Assessment & Scoring System

### Deadlines & Submission Rules

Each project has **two deadlines**:

| Submission Time | Max Score | Notes |
|-----------------|---------|-------|
| Before **1st Sunday** | 100 | Auto-graded after midnight |
| Before **2nd Sunday** | 65 | Second chance |
| After both deadlines | 50 | Manual "Mark Submission" required |

> ⚠️ After both deadlines:
> - No auto-checker runs automatically
> - You **must** click **"Mark Submission"** for each task
> - Failure to click = no score

---

### Weighted Average Calculation

Your **overall average** is calculated using a **weighted average**:
```
average = (score₁ × weight₁ + score₂ × weight₂ + ... + scoreₙ × weightₙ) / (weight₁ + weight₂ + ... + weightₙ)
```

#### Example:
- 3 projects scored 100 (weight = 1):  
  `(100×1 + 100×1 + 100×1) / 3 = 100`
- Add a 4th project scored 90 (weight = 2):  
  `(100+100+100+180) / 5 = 96`

> 🔍 **Key Insight**: Higher-weight projects (like capstone) impact your average more.

---

### Graduation Criteria

To graduate, you must:
- ✅ Complete **all milestone projects** (including capstone)
- ✅ Maintain an **overall average of 60% or higher**
- ✅ Participate in **Peer Learning Days**

#### Learner Status:
| Status | Criteria |
|-------|---------|
| **Engaged** | Active, average ≥ 60% |
| **On Probation** | Average < 60% or missed >2 weeks |
| **Non-Engaged** | Inactive >4 weeks post-probation |

> 🚨 If on probation, you have **2 weeks** to improve — support is available!

## 🧪 Auto Checker Guide

The **Auto Checker** automatically grades your code when you push to GitHub.

### How to Use:
1. Push your code to the correct GitHub repo
2. Click **"Check your code"** on Savanna
3. Select **"Start a new test"**
4. Wait for results (usually within minutes)

### Understanding Results:
| Icon | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| ✅ Green (thin border) | Requirement passed |
| ❌ Red (thin border) | Requirement failed |
| ✅ Green (thick border) | Code passed test |
| ❌ Red (thick border) | Code failed — check details |
| ⚙️ Red gear | Inefficient code — can be improved |

> 🔍 Expand each check to see detailed feedback and error messages.

## 📝 Manual Peer Reviews

Some projects require **manual peer review** to receive a score.

### How to Request a Review:
1. Complete your project
2. Click **"Ready for Manual Review"**
3. Share the generated link in the `#reviews` channel on Discord

### How to Give a Review:
1. Open the peer’s review link
2. Follow the rubric and use the slider to score
3. **Leave constructive comments**
4. Submit the review

### 🚫 Never give a zero unless:
- The answer is completely missing
- The document is blank
- The requirement was ignored

> ✅ If partially correct, give partial credit — fairness matters.

## 💬 The 4A Feedback Framework

A simple, powerful model for giving and receiving feedback:

### 📤 Giving Feedback:
- **Aim to Assist**: Help, don’t criticize
- **Actionable**: Suggest clear next steps

### 📥 Receiving Feedback:
- **Appreciate**: It’s a gift — listen with gratitude
- **Accept or Discard**: You don’t have to use it, but hear it first

> 🌟 *"Feedback should feel like guidance from a teammate, not judgment from a boss."*
